# API Security Findings

Based on the security audit tests and code analysis, here are the key findings:

## ðŸ”´ Critical Security Issues

### 1. Unprotected Upload Endpoint
- **Endpoint**: `POST /upload`
- **Issue**: No authentication required
- **Risk**: Anyone can upload arbitrary video files to your server
- **Location**: `/web/routes/processing_routes.py`
- **Recommendation**: Add `@require_auth` decorator immediately

### 2. Unprotected Media Files
- **Endpoints**: 
  - `GET /videos/<filename>`
  - `GET /thumbnails/<filename>`
- **Issue**: No authentication checks before serving files
- **Risk**: Unauthorized access to all captured videos and detection thumbnails
- **Recommendation**: Add authentication checks before serving files

## ðŸŸ¡ Important Findings

### 1. Missing Endpoints in Test Environment
- `/api/process-now` - Returns 404 (might be test configuration issue)
- `/api/cleanup-now` - Returns 404 (might be test configuration issue)

### 2. Two-System Architecture Security Gap
The system has two separate components with different security levels:
- **Processing Server**: Has authentication on most endpoints
- **Pi Capture Server**: Has NO authentication on any endpoints

If the Pi is directly accessible, all these endpoints are unprotected:
- Camera streams and snapshots
- Motion detection settings
- System information
- Video uploads

## ðŸŸ¢ Properly Protected Areas

### Well-Protected Endpoints (33 out of 76 endpoints = 43.4%)
- All admin endpoints (`/api/admin/*`)
- User management endpoints
- Authentication endpoints (login, refresh, etc.)
- Most system settings endpoints

### Public Endpoints (Intentionally Unprotected)
These are correctly public:
- `/api/debug/simple` - Basic connectivity test
- `/api/debug/test` - Service test
- `/api/setup/status` - Initial setup check
- `/api/auth/login` - Login endpoint
- `/api/register` - Registration (when enabled)
- `/api/verify-email` - Email verification

## ðŸ“Š Summary Statistics

- **Total Endpoints**: 76
- **Protected**: 33 (43.4%)
- **Intentionally Public**: 7 (9.2%)
- **Unprotected Sensitive**: 3+ identified
- **Unknown/Unclassified**: ~33

## ðŸš¨ Immediate Actions Required

1. **Add authentication to `/upload` endpoint**:
   ```python
   @app.route('/upload', methods=['POST'])
   @require_auth  # ADD THIS LINE
   def upload_video():
   ```

2. **Protect media file serving**:
   ```python
   @app.route('/videos/<filename>')
   @require_auth  # ADD THIS LINE
   def serve_video(filename):
   ```

3. **Either**:
   - Block direct access to Pi capture system (firewall/network rules)
   - OR add authentication to all Pi endpoints
   - OR ensure all access goes through authenticated proxy endpoints

## ðŸ”’ Security Best Practices

1. **Default Deny**: All endpoints should require authentication by default
2. **Explicit Public**: Only make endpoints public when explicitly needed
3. **Audit Regularly**: Run security tests as part of CI/CD
4. **Network Segmentation**: Keep Pi on isolated network, accessible only via processing server

## ðŸ§ª Testing Recommendations

The security audit test (`test_security_audit.py`) should be:
1. Run regularly as part of your test suite
2. Extended to check for proper authorization (not just authentication)
3. Updated as new endpoints are added

Remember: Authentication verifies WHO you are, Authorization verifies WHAT you can do.
