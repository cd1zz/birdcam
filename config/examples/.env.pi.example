# MULTI-CAMERA BEHAVIOR
# ================================

# ================================
# COMMON CAMERA CONFIGURATIONS
# ================================
# Here are some typical setups:

# --- Single CSI Camera (Raspberry Pi Camera Module) ---
# CAMERA_IDS=0
# CAMERA_0_TYPE=picamera2

# --- Single USB Camera ---
# CAMERA_IDS=0
# CAMERA_0_TYPE=opencv
# CAMERA_0_DEVICE=0

# --- CSI + USB Camera Combo ---
# CAMERA_IDS=0,1
# CAMERA_0_TYPE=picamera2          # CSI camera for motion detection
# CAMERA_1_TYPE=opencv             # USB camera as secondary
# CAMERA_1_DEVICE=0                # Usually /dev/video0

# --- Two USB Cameras ---
# CAMERA_IDS=0,1
# CAMERA_0_TYPE=opencv
# CAMERA_0_DEVICE=0                # First USB camera
# CAMERA_1_TYPE=opencv
# CAMERA_1_DEVICE=1                # Second USB camera

# ================================
# TROUBLESHOOTING TIPS
# ================================
# 1. Run 'libcamera-hello --list-cameras' to see CSI cameras
# 2. Run 'ls /dev/video*' to see available video devices
# 3. Camera 0 is ALWAYS the motion detection camera
# 4. If unsure, use TYPE=auto to let system detect
# 5. USB cameras usually appear at /dev/video0, /dev/video1, etc.
# 6. CSI cameras work best with picamera2
# 7. Some CSI cameras may appear as /dev/video2 or higher when using opencv
