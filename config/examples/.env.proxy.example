# Web UI Configuration - Proxy Mode
# This configuration uses the AI Processor as a secure proxy to the Pi
# Only one CloudFlare tunnel is needed (for the AI Processor)

# Processing Server URL (this will be your CloudFlare tunnel URL)
# Example: https://birdcam.example.com
# For local testing: http://192.168.1.200:8091
VITE_PROCESSING_SERVER=https://your-cloudflare-tunnel.com

# Pi Server URL - LEAVE EMPTY for proxy mode
# When empty, the UI will use /api/pi/* endpoints on the processing server
VITE_PI_SERVER=

# Note: With this configuration:
# - All requests go through the processing server
# - Authentication is enforced for camera access
# - Only one CloudFlare tunnel is needed
# - The Pi remains completely internal to your network
