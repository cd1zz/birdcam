# Security Summary: API Endpoints

## Executive Summary

The API has **good overall security coverage** with 78.7% of endpoints protected by authentication. However, there is **one critical security issue** that needs immediate attention.

## 🚨 Critical Issue

### Unprotected Upload Endpoint
- **Endpoint**: `POST /upload`
- **Current Status**: Accessible without authentication
- **Risk Level**: CRITICAL
- **Impact**: Anyone can upload arbitrary files to your server
- **Fix Required**: Add `@require_auth` decorator to this endpoint immediately

## ✅ Security Strengths

### Well-Protected Areas (48 out of 61 endpoints)
- ✅ All admin endpoints require authentication
- ✅ User management endpoints are protected
- ✅ System settings and configuration endpoints are secured
- ✅ Pi camera proxy endpoints require authentication
- ✅ Log viewing endpoints are protected
- ✅ Motion detection settings require authentication

### Properly Public Endpoints (10 endpoints)
These endpoints are intentionally public and this is correct:
- `/` - Main page
- `/api/auth/login` - Login (must be public)
- `/api/auth/refresh` - Token refresh
- `/api/debug/simple` - Basic connectivity test
- `/api/debug/test` - Service test
- `/api/setup/status` - Initial setup check
- `/api/setup/create-admin` - First admin creation (internal network only)
- `/api/register` - User registration (when enabled)
- `/api/verify-email` - Email verification
- `/api/resend-verification` - Resend verification

## 📊 Authentication Coverage

```
Total Endpoints: 61
Protected: 48 (78.7%)
Public by Design: 10 (16.4%)
Security Issue: 1 (1.6%)
Unknown Status: 2 (3.3%)
```

## 🔧 Immediate Action Required

Add authentication to the upload endpoint in `/web/routes/processing_routes.py`:

```python
@app.route('/upload', methods=['POST'])
@require_auth  # ← ADD THIS LINE
def upload_video():
    if 'video' not in request.files:
        return jsonify({'error': 'No video file'}), 400
    # ... rest of the function
```

## 📝 Additional Observations

1. **Media Files**: The analysis couldn't determine if `/videos/<filename>` and `/thumbnails/<filename>` endpoints are protected due to parameterized paths. These should be manually verified.

2. **Two PUT Endpoints**: `/api/admin/settings/email` and `/api/admin/settings/registration` couldn't be tested with simple GET/POST but likely require admin authentication based on their paths.

3. **Good Practice**: The system uses multiple levels of authentication:
   - `@require_auth` - Basic authentication
   - `@require_admin` - Admin role required
   - `@require_internal_network` - Network-based restriction
   - `@require_auth_internal` - Combined auth + network
   - `@require_admin_internal` - Admin + network

## 🎯 Recommendations

1. **Immediate**: Fix the `/upload` endpoint security issue
2. **Important**: Verify media file endpoints are protected
3. **Good Practice**: Add this security test to your CI/CD pipeline
4. **Future**: Consider adding rate limiting to public endpoints

## ✨ Overall Assessment

The BirdCam API has a well-structured security model with proper authentication on most endpoints. Once the upload endpoint is secured, the API will have excellent security coverage with no known vulnerabilities in the authentication layer.
